<b>Experimental Measurement of Certain Raspberry Pi Pico Parameters</b> <br>
As a beginning of the research done on variants of Raspberry Pi Pico models, I am explaining certain parameter measurements. Codes are developed both in MicroPython and Arduino, wherever is necessary. I am sure that I am not describing the parameters in systematic way (Randomly).<br>
## Unveiling the On-chip Temperature Sensor of Raspberry Pi Pico ##
I have already explained the On-chip temperature sensor in the following YouTube Short:<br>
**Unveiling the On chip Temperature Sensor of Raspberry Pi Pico**  (https://youtube.com/shorts/_W1XJNeHqDk)<br>
The MicroPython code for the above is given in this repository<br>
**Raspberry Pi Pico 2**<br>
The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 was introduced on 8th August 2024, costing 5$. It's a 2X dual core microcontroller (RP2350) with advanced features.
It has an integrated on-chip temperature sensor in the form of NPN-diode connected configuration as shown below, and the chip has greatly improved power efficiency.</br>
